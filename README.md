# ATM-BUDDY

This is an app that provides mobile utilities to amateur optics workers. It is to my knowledge only used by Paul, my friend from Gallifrey Optics, and me.

It is live at https://lucassifoni.github.io/atm-buddy and can be added to your home screen thanks to the app manifest.

## Develop

```
npm i -g yarn
yarn
yarn dev
```

## Features
- Save (locally) your optical pieces, tools, and spherometers
- Use little tools :
  - 📏 Spherometer to ROC
  - 🔄 ROC to Spherometer
  - 📐 Sagitta Calculator
  - 📊 Sine tablext-xs
  - 🔭 Baader MPCCIII Hyperbola
  - 🪞 Spray Silvering calculations
  - 👁️ Stig Correction Reminder
  - ⭕ Annular Ring Calculatorxt-xs
  - 🌊 ROC Fringes
  - ⚖️ Pressure Calculator
  - 🔧 Hardware manager
  
### Feature lifecycle as of 2025

```
Paul asks for a feature
  -> we discuss it
      -> I make an LLM do it
          -> he gets his tool quickly after and actually works on optics with it
```

### You can add features too !

This is a low-stakes, low-key, low-tech tool. You can add features manually or by using LLMs if you want and if they are genuinely useful in an amateur optics setting. Just explore a bit the code, loosely respect the current informal conventions,  and send a PR.

### Current roadmap

- Paul is drawing icons to replace the emoji
- Someone else is maybe drawing an icon to replace the DFTFringe screenshot currently used
